## Contributing to [PACKAGE_NAME]

If you have a question about [PACKAGE_NAME] (not a bug report) please post it to [YOUR@EMAIL.ADDRESS]

### Reporting bugs

- Before opening a new issue, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues) to avoid duplication. If the issue does not yet exist, [create one](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues/new).
  - Please post any relevant code samples, preferably a standalone script that
    reproduces your issue. Do **not** describe your issue in prose. **Show your code.**
  - If the bug involves an error, please post the stack trace.
  - Please post the version of [PACKAGE_NAME] that you're using.
  - Please write bug reports in JavaScript (ES5, ES6, etc) / TypeScript that runs in Node.js and browser, **not** CoffeeScript, JSX, etc.

### Requesting new features

- Before opening a new issue, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues) to avoid duplication. If the issue does not yet exist, [create one](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues/new).
- Please describe a use case for it
- Please include test cases if possible

### Fixing bugs / Adding features

- Before starting to write code, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues). That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch. You can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/issues/new).
  - _The source of this project is written in JavaScript and TypeScript, not CoffeeScript. Please write your bug reports in JavaScript/TypeScript that can run in vanilla Node.js and browser_.
- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME) _or_ for small documentation changes, navigate to the source on github and click the [Edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button) button.
- Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project:
  - 2 space tabs
  - no trailing whitespace
  - inline documentation for new methods, class members, etc.
  - 1 space between conditionals, no space before function parenthesis
    - `if (..) {`
    - `for (..) {`
    - `while (..) {`
    - `function(err) {`
- Follow semantic versioning and release guidelines using semantic-release-cli and commit through git-cz
- Write tests and make sure they pass.
- Write typings-tests if you modify the typescript-typings.

### Running the tests

- Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project
- execute `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
- execute `npm run build` to build the code
- execute `npm test` to run the tests

### Documentation
